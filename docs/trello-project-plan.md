# BookFinder AI Discord Bot - Trello Project Plan

## Project Overview
Create an AI-powered Discord bot that helps users find books based on descriptions, themes, or partial information. The bot leverages OpenAI's language models and book APIs to provide intelligent book search and recommendations.

## Trello Board Structure

### Lists
1. **Backlog** - All tasks that need to be done eventually
2. **To Do** - Tasks prioritized for the current sprint
3. **In Progress** - Tasks currently being worked on
4. **Testing** - Tasks being tested before completion
5. **Done** - Completed tasks
6. **Issues** - Blockers and problems to be resolved

### Task Breakdown

#### Setup & Architecture (Day 1 - Morning)
- [x] Create GitHub repository
- [x] Set up basic Node.js project
- [x] Install dependencies (discord.js, openAI, axios, dotenv)
- [x] Create basic file structure
- [ ] Create .env file with API keys (discord, openAI, Google Books)
- [ ] Test connection to Discord API
- [ ] Test connection to OpenAI API
- [ ] Test connection to Google Books API
- [ ] Design bot architecture (services, commands, utils)

#### Core Functionality (Day 1 - Afternoon to Day 2 - Morning)
- [x] Create OpenAI service for AI interactions
- [x] Implement natural language parsing for book queries
- [x] Create book service for API interactions
- [x] Implement Google Books API integration
- [x] Implement Open Library API as fallback
- [x] Create slash command for finding books
- [x] Create slash command for book recommendations
- [ ] Design and implement embed responses
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging
- [ ] Test core functionality with sample queries

#### Basic Enhanced Features (Day 2 - Afternoon)
- [ ] Add support for book categories/genres
- [ ] Design help command with examples
- [ ] Implement basic response caching for performance
- [ ] Test commands with various queries

#### Deployment & Documentation (Day 3 - Morning)
- [ ] Set up basic hosting environment
- [ ] Configure environment variables for production
- [ ] Write user documentation for commands
- [ ] Create sample use cases
- [ ] Test bot in a real Discord server

#### Testing & Refinement (Day 3 - Afternoon)
- [ ] Test bot with real users
- [ ] Collect feedback and make quick improvements
- [ ] Fix any critical bugs or issues
- [ ] Prepare presentation materials
- [ ] Final testing and verification

## Risk Management
- **API Rate Limits**: Monitor usage of OpenAI and Google Books APIs to avoid hitting rate limits
- **Testing Time Constraints**: Focus on core functionality first, enhancements only if time permits
- **Presentation Readiness**: Ensure at least core book search and recommendation features work well for demo

## Definition of Done
- Core functionality (book search and recommendations) is working reliably
- Bot can be demonstrated in a Discord server
- Basic documentation is complete
- Presentation materials are prepared

## Milestone Schedule
1. **Day 1**: Project setup and core functionality implementation
2. **Day 2**: Testing core features and adding basic enhancements
3. **Day 3**: Documentation, final testing, and preparation for presentation
